You may not consult the internet except to look up [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.8.html) or [matplotlib documentation](https://matplotlib.org/contents.html). You may consult the course textbook, course notes, and course videos. You may, of course, ask me clarifying questions. But I will not give any other assistance.\n",

For those in far away time zones I will set aside some times in late evening (EST) and early morning. Local students should please not use those appointment times.\n",
